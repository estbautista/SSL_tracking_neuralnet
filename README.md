# Semi-supevised learning tracking using a neural network

Python implementation and comparison of analytical methods and a neural network trained to update the solution of semi-supervised learning methods when the graph topology evolves. The graph evolution is controlled via a dynamic SBM class given [here](https://github.com/estbautista/DynSBM).
